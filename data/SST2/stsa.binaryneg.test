the unceasing sadism is so graphically excessive , the director just ends up exposing his own obsession .
imagine the james woods character from videodrome making a home movie of audrey rose and showing it to the kid from the sixth sense and you 've imagined the ring .
this film was made to get laughs from the slowest person in the audience -- just pure slapstick with lots of inane , inoffensive screaming and exaggerated facial expressions .

scene-by-scene , things happen , but you 'd be hard-pressed to say what or why .
at nearly three hours , the whole of safe conduct is less than the sum of its parts .
dawdles and drags when it should pop ; it does n't even have the virtue of enough mindless violence to break up the tedium of all its generational bonding .
places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting , and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller .
trivial where it should be profound , and hyper-cliched where it should be sincere .
good for a few unintentional laughs , `` extreme ops '' was obviously made for the `` xxx '' crowd , people who enjoy mindless action without the benefit of decent acting , writing , and direction .
what happened with pluto nash ?
notorious c.h.o. has oodles of vulgar highlights .
before long , the film starts playing like general hospital crossed with a saturday night live spoof of dog day afternoon .
it 's just a silly black genre spoof .
as written by michael berg and michael j. wilson from a story by wilson , this relentless , all-wise-guys-all-the-time approach tries way too hard and gets tiring in no time at all .
splashes its drama all over the screen , subjecting its audience and characters to action that feels not only manufactured , but also so false you can see the filmmakers ' puppet strings .
there 's no denying the elaborateness of the artist 's conceptions , nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan , but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense , lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity .
if we do n't demand a standard of quality for the art that we choose , we deserve the trash that we get .
might have been better off as a documentary , with less of mr. eyre 's uninspired dramatics and more of his sense of observation and outrage .
it tries too hard , and overreaches the logic of its own world .
it 's neither as romantic nor as thrilling as it should be .

though everything might be literate and smart , it never took off and always seemed static .
we miss the quirky amazement that used to come along for an integral part of the ride .
while the mystery surrounding the nature of the boat 's malediction remains intriguing enough to sustain mild interest , the picture refuses to offer much accompanying sustenance in the way of characterization , humor or plain old popcorn fun .
cho 's fans are sure to be entertained ; it 's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that -- on the basis of this film alone -- i 'm not one of them .

too lazy to take advantage of its semi-humorous premise .
you 'll be more entertained getting hit by a bus .
there are touching moments in etoiles , but for the most part this is a dull , dour documentary on what ought to be a joyful or at least fascinating subject .
what 's at stake in this film is nothing more than an obsolete , if irritating , notion of class .
offensive in the way it exploits the hot-button issue of domestic abuse for cheap thrills and disgusting in the manner it repeatedly puts a small child in jeopardy , treating her as little more than a prop to be cruelly tormented .
it would n't be my preferred way of spending 100 minutes or $ 7.00 .
a monster combat thriller as impersonal in its relentlessness as the videogame series that inspired it .
life is a crock -- or something like it .
the weight of water uses water as a metaphor for subconscious desire , but this leaky script barely stays afloat .
automatically pegs itself for the straight-to-video sci-fi rental shelf .
one minute , you think you 're watching a serious actioner ; the next , it 's as though clips from the pink panther strikes again and\/or sailor moon have been spliced in .
a boring , wincingly cute and nauseatingly politically correct cartoon guaranteed to drive anyone much over age 4 screaming from the theater .
never quite transcends jokester status ... and the punchline does n't live up to barry 's dead-eyed , perfectly chilled delivery .
choppy editing and too many repetitive scenes spoil what could have been an important documentary about stand-up comedy .
an unsatisfying hybrid of blair witch and typical stalk-and-slash fare , where the most conservative protagonist is always the last one living .
unfortunately , they 're sandwiched in between the most impossibly dry account of kahlo 's life imaginable .
this extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long .
a strong first quarter , slightly less so second quarter , and average second half .
earnest but earthbound ... a slow , soggy , soporific , visually dank crime melodrama\/character study that would be more at home on the small screen but for its stellar cast .
it 's as flat as an open can of pop left sitting in the sun .
a movie far more cynical and lazy than anything a fictitious charlie kaufman might object to .
a sour , nasty offering .
everyone connected to this movie seems to be part of an insider clique , which tends to breed formulaic films rather than fresh ones .
this time kaufman 's imagination has failed him .
suggests puns about ingredients and soup and somebody being off their noodle , but let 's just say the ingredients do n't quite add up to a meal .
this is junk food cinema at its greasiest .
-lrb- director -rrb- byler may yet have a great movie in him , but charlotte sometimes is only half of one .
shamelessly sappy and , worse , runs away from its own provocative theme .
it 's the kind of movie that ends up festooning u.s. art house screens for no reason other than the fact that it 's in french -lrb- well , mostly -rrb- with english subtitles and is magically ` significant ' because of that .
another rent installment for the ian fleming estate .
instead of kicking off the intrigue and suspense and mystery of the whole thing , hart 's war , like the st. louis rams in the super bowl , waits until after halftime to get started .
some of seagal 's action pictures are guilty pleasures , but this one is so formulaic that it seems to be on auto-pilot .
for caine lovers only .
a trashy , exploitative , thoroughly unpleasant experience .
opens at a funeral , ends on the protagonist 's death bed and does n't get much livelier in the three hours in between .
... surprisingly inert for a movie in which the main character travels back and forth between epochs .
but it pays a price for its intricate intellectual gamesmanship .
the lack of opposing viewpoints soon grows tiresome -- the film feels more like a series of toasts at a testimonial dinner than a documentary .
wait for video -- and then do n't rent it .

these spiders can outrun a motorcycle and wrap a person in a sticky cocoon in seconds , but they fall short of being interesting or entertaining .
there are weird resonances between actor and role here , and they 're not exactly flattering .
the fight scenes are fun , but it grows tedious .

not a movie but a live-action agitprop cartoon so shameless and coarse , it 's almost funny .

a painfully leaden film destined for pre-dawn cable television slots .
it would be hard to think of a recent movie that has worked this hard to achieve this little fun .
a recipe for cinematic disaster ... part quentin tarantino , part guy ritchie , and part 1960s spy spoof , it 's all bad .
the furious coherence that -lrb- deniro -rrb- brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself , which feels , as it plods toward the end , less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing .
you might not buy the ideas .
